## 🧪 Experimental Features

Want to try cutting-edge features? Check out the `experimental` branch for:
- Advanced water effects (bleeding, wet-on-wet)
- New brush algorithms
- Animation capabilities
- Additional export formats
- Performance optimizations

⚠️ **Note**: Experimental features may be unstable or change frequently.

## 🤝 Contributing

### For Stable Features
1. Branch from `stable` for safety
2. Test thoroughly before merging
3. Maintain backward compatibility

### For Experimental Features
1. Branch from `experimental`
2. Mark unstable features clearly
3. Document any breaking changes

## 🎨 Art Inspiration

Based on the watercolor simulation techniques popularized by Tyler Hobbs and other generative artists, focusing on:
- Organic, natural-looking edges
- Realistic watercolor transparency
- Subtle color variation and bleeding
- Balanced composition
